# DOM Manipulation Contact form component

## Description

The form has: 2 text inputs, 1 radio button, 1 text area, 1 submit button and an image on the right, just to make the form look a little better.

- When clicking the “Submit” button, the required fields are validated , and a red border will be displayed around the input if validation fails.
- If user corrects the error, the red border will be removed.
- When the form is successfully submitted (no validation errors) a Confirmation banner (which is hidden initially) will be displayed containing the user’s first name that was just collected from the input fields. Also all the info from the input fields will be printed in the Console.
